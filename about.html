							<h1>About Me<br /></h1>
							
						</header>
						<p>I am a software engineer and lifelong learner. With a background in healthcare, I transitioned to the software engineering industry. I bring with me the ability to learn new systems quickly, work hard, communicate complex information in simple terms, have attention to detail and strong skills in working in a team environment, and the ability to empathize with clients. My goal in the software engineering field is to leverage my background as a healthcare provider to incorporate a passion for learning into the design of technological tools that will improve user interactions for everyone.</p>

										<h1>My Story</h1>
									</header>

									

									<p>In high school I wasnâ€™t sure what exactly I wanted to do with my life, and ended up going for exercise science and Physical Therapy as my mom is a personal trainer and my Grandmother had a stroke while I was in high school and I felt I could learn how to help people like her.</p>
							<p>I ended up specializing in neurologic physical therapy through a residency program working with people with various disabilities, from patients with strokes, brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, and degenerative diseases, and worked with so much technology that had major impacts, whether positive or negative depending on the program.</p>
							<p>This included technology such as virtual reality, vision board communication tools, and also just trying to schedule appointments or reminders on their phones. It sparked an interest in me to try to make technologies that are user friendly, inclusive of people of all abilities and make an impact on their life.</p>
							<p>I then started learning to code and found my passion for it as I am very goal oriented and get immense satisfaction when I put a lot of work into a task and get a result in the end.</p>
